## 1. Forewords
Although the subject initially proposed was concerning alphago, the recent publication of Deep Mind concerning AlphaGo Zero, its successor, cannot be ignored, especially the very meaning of "Zero" in it's name ...   
That's why this research will concentrate on Alpha Go zero and try to explain why this "Zero" is so important.

## 2. Introduction
AlphaGo Zero is the latest development of Google DeepMind's Go AI player.   
While AlphaGo, it's predecessor, was able to beat the world's best Go player - something thought to be impossible just a few years ago - this new version is way ahead of it's venerable ancestor not only because it was able to beat it to a final score of **100** to **0** but also by the ressources it needed to do so.

## 3. Final score: 100 to 0
Let's go back a little to the time when Alpha Go beated the - now - famous Lee Sedol, world champion of Go.
